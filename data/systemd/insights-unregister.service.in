# Any changes made to this file will be overwritten during a software update. To
# override a parameter in this file, create a drop-in file, typically located at
# /etc/systemd/system/insights-unregister.service.d/override.conf. Put the
# desired overrides in that file and reload systemd. The next time this service
# is run (either manually or via a systemd timer), the overridden values will be
# in effect.
#
# For more information about systemd drop-in files, see systemd.unit(5).
