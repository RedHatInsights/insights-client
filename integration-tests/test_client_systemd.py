    :description:
        Ensure that the insights-client data upload is triggered by the
        systemd timer and the last check-in time is updated accordingly
    :tags: Tier 1
    :steps:
        1. Register the system
        2. Note the last_check_in in host details from inventory
        3. Edit insights-client timer to run every 3 minutes (24 hours is
            too long to wait for a test, 3 min appears be a decent wait)
        4. Wait for upload to finish
        5. Again note the last_check_in in host details from inventory
        6. Verify the updated last_check_in time
    :expectedresults:
        1. System is registered
        2. The last_check_in time is recorded from the inventory
        3. The timer is adjusted to a 3-minute interval and upload proceeds
            as expected.
        4. Upload is finished successfully
        5. The last_check_in time is recorded from the inventory
        6. The last_check_in time is updated, reflecting a successful upload
